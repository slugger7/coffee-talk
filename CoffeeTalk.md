- Some "rules" can be broken



## Finding coffee you like

- Personal choice
- Roast date (always within 4 weeks)
- Processing:
    - Natural - fruitier cup 
    - Washed - more balanced
    - ...

## Basics

- Water (usuallay warm)
- Coffee (ground)
- Time
- Agitation
- Pressure (sometimes)
- Crushed roasted seed broth :)



### Water

- 98.75% of the cup
- Really important
- Clean filtered water
- Evian

### Coffee

- What coffee?
- Freshly roasted (nothing older than 4 weeks).
- Roast date not use by date
- Whole bean coffee (not ground if possible)



### Time

- How long the cofee and water is in contact
- The more time the more you extract
- More on this later



### Agitation

- Stirring
- Create turbulance in slurry
- Increses extraction



### Temperature

- At what temperature the water you are brewing with is
- Constant temperature
- Not that important to start out with



### Pressure

- Not always applicable (immersion brews, gravity)
- Aeropress, Espresso



## Grinders

- Grinder grinds coffe into smaller particles
- Increases surface area of coffee for extraction
- Uniform distribution
- More uniform grind = more even extraction
- Bean density: how hard or compact the bean is



### Blade

- Use it for spices instead
- Very difficult or impossible to get the same grind size twice
- Fines & boulders
- Just don't (Let your roaster grind for you)



### Conical Burr

- Steel vs Ceramic
- Can be cheap or very expensive
- Preferred choice
- Hario, Porlex, Severin problem



### Flat Burr

- More geared toward espresso
- EK43

### Grind Quality Scale

1. Fresh beans ground on demand (no blades but burrs)
1. Fresh Pre-ground
1. Fresh beans with blade grinder
1. Stale Beans
1. Stale Pre-ground



## Extraction

- Overextraction - Extracting the bad bits of the bean
- Underextraction - Not extracting all of the good stuff
- Under and over extracted (crap grinder) - Usually get this with the Hario Skerton Grinder
- Hence why a good grinder is necessary



## Variable relationships

- More time => Coarser grind
- Less time => Finer grind
- More time => Less agitation
- Less time => More agitation
- More time => Less pressure
- Less time => More pressure
- More time => Lower temperature
- Less Time => Higher temperature

Notes:
- In terms of time as that is something that we can easily control
- Cant always choose grind size



## Ratios

- Coffee:Water
- 1:11 (strong) -> 1:18 (weak) - personal preference
- I prefer the 1:15 -> 1: 16 (pour over)
- One gram of coffee has big impact on ratio

## How to start

- Off the boil water (no you cant burn the coffee with boiling water (Roaster))
- Get your ratio
- Change 1 variable at a time
- Time and Grind size is usually easy to change depending on method



## Pour Over

- Scott Rao method kind of
- 30g Cofee ground to sugar consistency (bit smaller)
- 90g bloom water for 40 seconds
- 480g single pour in circles slowly
- Swirl and leave
- 3:30 time sometimes (bean density makes a difference to the extraction)



![V60 Bloom](./assets/v60-bloom.jpg)



## Aeropress

- Don't know where I got it but it works for me
- Inverted method
- 16g Coffee ground to table salt
- 50g blooom water for 30 seconds with a few stirs (depending on bean density)
- 250g water all in create turbulance
- Flip & start pressing at 1:15 finish at 2:00 max (depending on agitation turbulance & bean density)



## Clenliness

- Rancid coffee oils on equipment
- Wash equipment after 250g bears (1 bag)
- Rinse equipment after use
- Brush grinder out between bags of beans
